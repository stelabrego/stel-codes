It would be interesting to try to build a function that can generate shortcode extensions for clj-markdown. I want to emulate Hugo because they got so many things right. I need shortcode support. I think clj-markdown could easily support shortcodes due to the simple nature of the parser. I could just check for `^{{` or whatever the shortcode syntax is at the beginning of the line. I would probably have to ensure the line wasn't part of a paragraph, code block, or whatever else but I believe clj-markdown includes that information in the state map.

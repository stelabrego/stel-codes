I wanted to make available the article data from within a tag index, so at first I copied the article maps into the index maps. But then I also wanted the tag index uri from within the article map, and I couldn't also copy the tag index maps because then it would be a circular dependency. So I thought, how can I avoid copying? I could just make them *easier to look up*. I could create a reference. But how? A generated id int? A uuid? Just using the index position in the article vector? What about using the title? Well that could work, but then I realized: why not just use the *slug*? It needs to be unique within categories anyway, I could just make it need to be unique across all identies. And switch the name to `id` instead. The `id` of tag and category indicies will just be the tag or category. So much simpler!

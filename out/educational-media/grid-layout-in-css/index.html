That&apos;s not a very controversial opinion! It&apos;s difficult to position items exactly as intended, and it&apos;s even harder to write CSS code that&apos;s readable afterwards. For instance, the second most upvoted CSS question on Stack Overflow is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/114543/how-to-horizontally-center-an-element">&quot;How to horizontally center an element&quot;</a>.</p><p>The CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox">Flexbox Box Layout Module</a> became widely supported <a href="https://caniuse.com/flexbox">around 2014</a>. This was a major improvement over past layout techniques. However, flexbox was mostly a way to build layouts in one direction: either horizontally or vertically. For this purpose, flexbox is great. But screens have two dimensions! So of course there was still a need for a CSS layout module that could position items both horizontally and vertically while handling all the complexities that come with that power.</p><p>That&apos;s where the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid">CSS Grid Layout Module</a> comes into the mix. It became widely supported <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-grid">around 2017</a>. The CSS Grid properties finally allow developers to write two-dimesional layouts in a concise, readable fashion.</p><p>However, CSS Grid is complex. It definitely takes some time to get used to. Even after writing several website layouts using the grid layout module, I still have to refer back to reference websites. Here&apos;s a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids">great MDN introduction</a> and my <a href="https://grid.malven.co/">favorite CSS Grid cheatsheet</a>.</p><p>I find that one of the best ways for me to learn a new technology is to read a book about it. I came across &quot;Grid Layout in CSS&quot; and I had to pick it up! I&apos;m really glad I did. This book is a thorough guide into the complexities of CSS Grid. It features many diagrams and examples which illustrate the power and nuances hidden within.</p><p>One of my favorite things about this book is that Eric Meyer goes into the &quot;why&quot; behind the CSS Grid standard. I learn much better when someone can tell me the &quot;why&quot; behind what I&apos;m learning.</p><p>I also love that occasionally Eric will critique the standard! For example, he opines that although <code>fr</code> values are not currently allowed as minimums, they should be and probably will in the future. Later, when Eric talks about the <code>grid</code> property, Eric writes my favorite passage in the whole book:</p><blockquote><p>The syntax is a little bit migraine-inducing, I admit, but we‚Äôll step through it a piece at a time.</p><p>Let‚Äôs get to the elephant in the room right away: grid allows you to either define a grid template or you can set the grid‚Äôs flow and auto-track sizing in a compact syntax. You can‚Äôt do both at the same time.</p><p>Furthermore, whichever you don‚Äôt define is reset to its defaults, as is normal for a shorthand property. So if you define the grid template, then the flow and auto tracks will be returned to their default values. This includes grid gutters, a topic we haven‚Äôt even covered yet. You can‚Äôt set the gutters with grid, but it will reset them anyway.</p><p>Yes, this is intentional. No, I don‚Äôt know why.</p></blockquote><p>Most coding guides will just tell you how it is. But I love the commentary! It helps me contextualize the design decisions. Humans aren&apos;t perfect and <em>occassionally</em> we make poor abstractions. Ok, maybe not so occassionally. It&apos;s good to know when something doesn&apos;t quite make sense to the experts on the topic either!</p><p>Grid is my go-to layout tool nowadays. Reading this book helped me realize that CSS Grid can basically do everything Flexbox can do, but much much more. So lately I&apos;ve been avoiding Flexbox altogether and using Grid for all my layout needs. The result is much more readable S/CSS files and less &quot;gotchas&quot; that frequently plague writers of CSS, both beginner and experts alike.</p><p>If you&apos;re interested in using CSS Grid, definitely give this book a read! I think it&apos;s a great reference and I&apos;ll definitely be revisiting in the future.</p><div class="circles"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-circle"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle></svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-circle"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle></svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-circle"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="10"></circle></svg></div></article></div></section></main><footer><p>Stel Abrego 2021</p></footer></body></html>
